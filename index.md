## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in the Scientific Computing & Imaging Institute (SCI) at the University of Utah, advised by Prof. Valerio Pascucci. My research focuses on data visualization, topological data analysis (TDA), scientific computing, and machine learning for digital pathology.

Before joining the Kahlert School of Computing, I completed an M.A. in Mathematics at UC Santa Barbara, where I studied algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. I also earned a B.Eng. in Polymer Science and Engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China.
