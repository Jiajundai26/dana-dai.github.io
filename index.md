## About

I am a first-year PhD student in the Scientific Computing & Imaging Institute (SCI) at the University of Utah, advised by Prof. Valerio Pascucci. My research lies at the intersection of data visualization, topological data analysis and machine learning for large-scale biomedical imaging.

Before joining the Kahlert School of Computing, I completed an M.A. in Mathematics at UC Santa Barbara, where I focused on algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. I also hold a B.Eng. in Polymer Science and Engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China.

## Research Interests

- Data visualization for scientific and biomedical data  
- Topological data analysis (TDA) and computational topology  
- Machine learning for digital pathology (H\&E histopathology, WSI)
