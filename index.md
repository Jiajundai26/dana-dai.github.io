## About Me
I am a first-year PhD student in the Scientific Computing & Imaging Institute (SCI), advised by Prof. Valerio Pascucci. My research interests include data visualization, topological data analysis, and machine learning for large-scale biomedical imaging. I am currently working on computational pipelines and visualization frameworks for histopathology whole-slide images, with a focus on interpretability, multi-resolution analysis, and robust model evaluation.

Previously, I completed my M.A. in Mathematics at University of California Santa Barbara, where my work centered on algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, numerical analysis, and scientific computing.

## Research Interests 
- Topological data analysis and geometric algorithms  
- Visualization for extreme-scale scientific datasets  
- Machine learning for digital pathology (WSI analysis)
- Deep learning for PDEs
